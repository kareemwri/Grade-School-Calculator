# Grade-School-Calculator

I created this little calculator for my son who is going from grade 3 to 4.  I am teaching him long division, multiplication with larger numbers, and fractions during his summer break of 2020.  Most of these are at a 5-6th grade level.  So he and I thought it would be nice if he had a calculator that could reduce frations or do basic operations on fractions and such.  So I made one for him.  It's basic but he really enjoys using this over siri!!
